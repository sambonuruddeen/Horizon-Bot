## Running the Streamlit App

This README outlines the steps to run the Streamlit app using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python (version 3.11)
* [Streamlit library](Streamlit.io)

**Instructions:**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   Locate the main Streamlit app script (usually named `app.py` or similar). In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

**Additional Notes:**

* You can specify a different port to run the app on by adding the `--port` flag followed by the desired port number. For example:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --port 8501
   ```

* Refer to the Streamlit documentation for further customization options: Streamlit docs: [https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/)
